Hi, I'm Omar. I'm a software engineer and open-source hacker passionate about low-level systems programming, software freedom, and using arcane computer knowledge to solve problems. I spend most of my professional time working on [drgn](https://github.com/osandov/drgn) (a programmable debugger) and the [Linux kernel](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/log/?qt=author&q=Omar+Sandoval). On the personal side, I am a husband, father, <dfn title="an American of Mexican descent">Chicano</dfn>, and enjoy playing the guitar.

This blog documents problems I've solved and interesting things I've learned.
